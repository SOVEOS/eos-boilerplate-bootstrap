# eos-boilerplate-bootstrap

boilerplate for eos projects using bootstrap, eosjs, scattterjs, anchor, animatecss, material design, fontawesome, etc..
can pull data from smart contracts regardless if logged into a wallet or not and can use scatter / tokenpocket, or anchor as your wallet of choice :)

pulling data from sovspacegame contract, the html displays [object Object] [object Object] because i don't specify what exactly to display from the tables because just testing to make sure it works and it does.  use the console to pull up the objects, which are named 'markets' and 'area'

have fun and feel free to use to BUILD SOMETHING ON EOS :D

just remember you have to set your project license to GNU (and of course open-source) if you use this boilerplate, besides that you can pretty much do whatever you want!
