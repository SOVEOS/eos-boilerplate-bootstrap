# eos-boilerplate-bootstrap

boilerplate for eos projects using bootstrap, eosjs, scattterjs, anchor, animatecss, material design, fontawesome, etc..
can pull data from smart contracts regardless if logged into a wallet or not and can use scatter / tokenpocket, or anchor as your wallet of choice :)

pulling some example data from sovspacegame contract. use the console to pull up the objects, which are named 'markets' and 'area' to see all the other information available from the tables it is pulling from.  

have fun and feel free to use to BUILD SOMETHING ON EOS :D

just remember you have to set your project license to GNU (and of course open-source) if you use this boilerplate, besides that you can pretty much do whatever you want!
